## [M01] — 2026-05-12

Docker plumbing proof. `layerx nginx:latest` prints layer count to stdout.

### Added
- `image/` package: `Resolver` interface, `DockerResolver` implementation
- Docker image tar export and `manifest.json` parsing
- Automatic image pull if not available locally
- `cmd/` package: cobra CLI with `ExactArgs(1)` validation
- CI pipeline: build, vet, test, cross-compile (linux/darwin/windows)
- Unit tests for tar parsing logic

### Technical
- Uses `github.com/moby/moby/client` with `WithAPIVersionNegotiation()`
- `FileTree`, `FileNode`, `DiffType` types defined as placeholders for M05
- `Layer` struct includes all fields needed through M05 (Size, Command, Tree)
